### Get Started with **Link-Shortify**

Welcome to **Link-Shortify**! This project is built using **Next.js** as the foundation, providing a powerful framework for modern web development. Below are the steps to get started, including how to set up the development environment, build the project, and run essential scripts.

#### Prerequisites

Ensure the following software is installed on your system:

- **Node.js** (version 18 or later recommended)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js) or **yarn** (if preferred)
- **Docker** (optional, for specific testing configurations)

---

#### Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

bash

Copy code

`git clone <repository-url>
cd client
npm install`

---

#### Development Workflow

Start the development server:

bash

Copy code

`npm run dev`

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the app.

---

#### Building for Production

To create a production build:

bash

Copy code

`npm run build`

Serve the production build locally:

bash

Copy code

`npm start`

---

#### Linting and Formatting

- **Lint code**: `npm run lint`
- **Fix linting errors**: `npm run lint:fix`
- **Check code formatting (Prettier)**: `npm run lint:prettier`
- **Fix code formatting**: `npm run lint:prettier:fix`
- **Lint stylesheets**: `npm run lint:style`
- **Fix stylesheet issues**: `npm run lint:style:fix`

---

#### Testing

Run different types of tests:

1.  **Unit tests** (via Jest):

    ```bash
    npm run test:unit
    ```

2.  **Visual regression tests** (via Loki):

    - Test current UI:

      ```bash
      npm run test:ui
      ```

    - Approve visual changes:

      ```bash
      npm run test:ui:ok
      ```

    - Run tests in CI:

      ```bash
      npm run test:ui:ci
      ```

    - Generate test reports:

      ```bash
      npm run test:ui:report
      ```

---

#### Storybook for UI Development

Launch **Storybook** to develop and view UI components in isolation:

```bash
npm run storybook
```

Build a static version of Storybook for deployment:

```bash
npm run storybook:build
```

---

#### Pre-commit Hooks

The project uses **Husky** and **lint-staged** for pre-commit checks:

- Code is automatically linted and formatted before each commit.
