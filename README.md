### Get Started with **Link-Shortify**

Welcome to **Link-Shortify**! This project is built using **Next.js** as the foundation, providing a powerful framework for modern web development. Below are the steps to get started, including how to set up the development environment, build the project, and run essential scripts.

#### Prerequisites

Ensure the following software is installed on your system:

- **Node.js** (version 18 or later recommended)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js) or **yarn** (if preferred)
- **Docker** (optional, for specific testing configurations)

---

#### Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YuHlushchenko/link-shortify.git
cd link-shortify
yarn install
```

---

#### Development Workflow

Start the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the app.

---

#### Building for Production

To create a production build:

```bash
yarn build
```

Serve the production build locally:

```bash
yarn start
```

---

#### Linting and Formatting

- **Lint code**: `npm run lint`
- **Fix linting errors**: `npm run lint:fix`
- **Check code formatting (Prettier)**: `npm run lint:prettier`
- **Fix code formatting**: `npm run lint:prettier:fix`
- **Lint stylesheets**: `npm run lint:style`
- **Fix stylesheet issues**: `npm run lint:style:fix`

---

#### Testing

Run different types of tests:

1.  **Unit tests** (via Jest):

    ```bash
    yarn test:unit
    ```

2.  **Visual regression tests** (via Loki):

    - Test current UI:

      ```bash
      yarn test:ui
      ```

    - Approve visual changes:

      ```bash
      yarn test:ui:ok
      ```

    - Run tests in CI:

      ```bash
      yarn test:ui:ci
      ```

    - Generate test reports:

      ```bash
      yarn test:ui:report
      ```

---

#### Storybook for UI Development

Launch **Storybook** to develop and view UI components in isolation:

```bash
yarn storybook
```

Build a static version of Storybook for deployment:

```bash
yarn storybook:build
```

---

#### Pre-commit Hooks

The project uses **Husky** and **lint-staged** for pre-commit checks:

- Code is automatically linted and formatted before each commit.

---

#### Setting up **i18n Ally** for the Project

**i18n Ally** is a VS Code extension that simplifies working with localization in your project [Official Documentation for i18n Ally](https://github.com/lokalise/i18n-ally). Below are the steps to configure it for your setup.

##### 1\. **Install the Extension**

Install **i18n Ally** in VS Code:

- Open the **Extensions** panel (Ctrl+Shift+X).
- Search for `i18n Ally`.
- Click **Install**.

##### 2\. **Create Configuration Files**

In the root of the project, create a directory named `.vscode` and add the following files:

###### **2.1. i18n-ally-custom-framework.yml**

This file customizes key detection in your project:

```bash
languageIds:
  - javascript
  - typescript
  - javascriptreact
  - typescriptreact

usageMatchRegex:
  - "[^\\w\\d]t\\(['\"`]({key})['\"`]\\)"
  - "[^\\w\\d]useTranslations\\(['\"`]({key})['\"`]\\)\\.\\w+"

scopeRangeRegex: "useTranslations\\(\\s*['\"`](.*?)['\"`]"

monopoly: true
```

###### **2.2. settings.json**

This file defines the main paths and format for your localization files:

```bash
{
  "i18n-ally.localesPaths": ["client/public/locales"],
  "i18n-ally.pathMatcher": "{locale}/{namespace}.json",
  "i18n-ally.keystyle": "nested"
}
```

##### 3\. **Usage**

Once configured:

- Open any file containing translation keys, and **i18n Ally** will automatically recognize them.
- Use the extension to manage keys, edit translations, and find usages directly from the editor.

Your project is now ready for smooth localization management with **i18n Ally**! ðŸš€
